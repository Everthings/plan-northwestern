# Plan Northwestern

**Currently in early beta.**


## About
**Plan Northwestern** is a website to help Northwestern students plan out their years of courses at the university. Find more information and get started at [https://plan-nu.dilanxd.com](https://plan-nu.dilanxd.com).

The current URL is temporary while it's in development and will most likely be changed once released to the general public.

## Contributing course data
Most of the course data was automatically scraped off of [Northwestern's course catalog](https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/courses-az/), including course names, numbers, descriptions, and units. Things like prerequisites were not scraped.

There are currently (or will be) features that make use of prerequisites (listing prereqs on the course, warning when adding course without prereqs, etc.) and major specific requirements (ex. basic engineering requirements for certain majors in McCormick), but because this data isn't easily available online in a consistent format, we're relying on users to help contribute course data!

*Contribution instructions coming soon.*


## Development
This project is completely open-source. While redistributing the project is not allowed, you're welcome to submit issues with feature requests, or potentially create them yourself and submit a pull request.

Honestly, GitHub Copilot helped a bit, too.
