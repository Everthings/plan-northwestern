# Plan Northwestern Feedback
Encounter a bug while using Plan Northwestern? Find any errors in course data? Have a suggestion for a new feature, user interface change, or anything? Let me know! I enjoy working on this project and would love to improve it.

There are multiple ways you can submit feedback.

## GitHub Issues
By clicking the [issues](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/issues?q=) tab above and creating a new issue, you can share your bug report or feature request (and attach any images as necessary).

This is preferred, since it'll help keep things organized, other people can see what feedback has been left already and upvote as necessary, I can follow up with any extra questions I have, and I can link updates I make to the code to the issue.

This requires a GitHub account.

## Feedback Form
If you don't have a GitHub account and would prefer not to make one, you can share your feedback anonymously using [this form](https://auth.dilanxd.com/plan-nu/feedback). Whatever you submit on there will automatically and instantly be posted on the issues page for you, where you can track the status of your feedback.
